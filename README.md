# Worst Fit Algorithm Simulation

This repository contains a web-based simulation of the **Worst Fit** memory allocation algorithm. The simulation demonstrates how memory blocks are allocated to processes based on the Worst Fit strategy, which selects the largest available block for allocation.

## Features
- Input memory block sizes and process memory requirements.
- Simulates the Worst Fit algorithm to allocate memory to processes.
- Displays results in a clear table format, showing allocated blocks and remaining memory sizes.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shancds/worst-fit-algorithm.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd worst-fit-algorithm
3. Open the **index.html** file in any modern web browser to start using the simulation.

## Usage

Enter memory block sizes and process memory requirements in the input fields.
Click "Simulate Allocation" to see the results of the Worst Fit algorithm.
The results will be displayed in a table, showing which blocks were allocated to each process and the remaining block sizes.
